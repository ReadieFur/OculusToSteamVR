Todo:
    ☐ Improve the calibration to be more accurate.
        ☐ New calibration idea, hold the controller infront of the HMD, similar to how Oculus initilizes tracking on the CV1, offset the controller slightly from there and allow fine tuning through a UI or something.
    ☐ Make a UI for the calibration instead of using the "identify device" button on the SteamVR dashboard.
    ☐ Get Oculus focus so that touch events can be obtained.

Done:
    ✔ Use LibOVR (native PC sdk for Oculus) to get the tracking data. @done(22-03-07 12:26)
    ✔ Roughly calibrate the Oculus origin in SteamVR space. @done(22-03-07 12:27)

Cancelled:
    ✘ Don't use a controller as the calibration refrence marker (figure out how to get a model to render for a tracking reference). @cancelled(22-03-08 02:54) Reason: New calibration idea.
