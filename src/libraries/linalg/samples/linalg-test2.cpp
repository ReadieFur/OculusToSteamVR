// For C++11 compliance, we've declared it `static`, meaning that each translation unit technically has its own copy of linalg::identity.
// If we could assume C++17 support, I'd prefer to instead declare it `inline`. Either way, we need to doublecheck that no duplicate
// definition issues occur when we include linalg.h from multiple translation units.
